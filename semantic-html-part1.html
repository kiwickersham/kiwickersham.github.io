            <h2><i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i></h2>
            <p>The <b><i>Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i></b> is a 2006 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube and Wii. Originally planned for release exclusively on the GameCube in November 2005, Nintendo delayed the release to refine the game, add more content, and port it to the Wii. The Wii version was a launch game in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was released in December 2006 as the final first-party game for the console.</p>
            <p>The game takes place over a century after <i>Ocarina of Time</i> and <i>Majora's Mask</i>, in an alternate timeline from <i>The Wind Waker</i>. Players control Link, who tries to prevent Hyrule from being engulfed by a corrupted parallel dimension, the Twilight Realm. He takes the form of both a Hylian and a wolf, and he is assisted by a mysterious imp named Midna.</p>
            <p><i>Twilight Princess</i> received critical acclaim, with praise for its art direction, combat, level design, and story. It received numerous game of the year awards, and has been called one of the greatest video games ever made. By 2015, it had sold 8.85 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling <i>Zelda</i> game until <i>Breath of the Wild</i> (2017). In 2011, the Wii version was rereleased under the Nintendo Selects label. A high-definition remaster based on the GameCube version, <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD</i>, developed by Tantalus Media, was released for the Wii U in March 2016. An eleven-volume manga series based on <i>Twilight Princess</i> by Akira Himekawa was published between 2016 and 2022. </p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> is an action-adventure game focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. It uses the basic control scheme introduced in <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, including context-sensitive action buttons and L-targeting (Z-targeting on the Wii), a system that allows the player to keep Link's view focused on an enemy or important object while moving and attacking. Link can walk, run, and attack, and he will automatically jump when running off of or reaching for a ledge. Link uses a sword and shield in combat, complemented with secondary weapons and items, including a bow and arrows, a boomerang, and bombs. While L-targeting, projectile-based weapons can be fired at a target without the need for manual aiming.</p>
            <figure> 
                <img src="/img/gameplay.jpg" width="375px" height="214px" alt="A boy in a green tunic holds a shield while swinging his sword towards an enemy. The enemy is indicated by a red arrow from the top of the screen.">
                <figcaption>An arrow points at an enemy whom Link is targeting as he prepares to swing his sword (GameCube version).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The context-sensitive button mechanic allows one button to serve a variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still.</p>
            <p>The GameCube and Wii versions feature several minor differences in their controls and gameplay. The Wii version uses the motion sensors and built-in speaker of the Wii Remote. The speaker emits the sounds of a bowstring when shooting an arrow, Midna's laugh when she gives advice to Link, and the series' trademark "chime" when discovering secrets. The player controls Link's sword by swinging the Wii Remote. Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the Nunchuk. In the GameCube version, players can control the camera freely, without entering a special "lookaround" mode required on the Wii; however, in the GameCube version, only two of Link's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time, as opposed to four in the Wii version.</p>
            <p>The game features nine dungeons—large, contained areas where Link battles enemies, collects items, and solves puzzles. Link navigates these dungeons and fights a boss at the end in order to obtain an item or otherwise advance the plot. The dungeons are connected by a large overworld, across which Link can travel on foot; on his horse, Epona; or by teleporting with Midna's assistance.</p>
            <p>When Link enters the Twilight Realm, the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule, he transforms into a wolf. He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms at will. As a wolf, Link loses the ability to use his sword, shield, or any secondary items; he instead attacks by biting and defends primarily by dodging attacks. "Wolf Link" gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does on foot as a human, digs holes to create new passages, and uncover buried items, and has improved senses, including the ability to follow scent trails. On his back, he also carries Midna, a small imp-like creature who gives him hints, uses an energy field to attack enemies, helps him jump long distances, and eventually allows him to "warp" to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld. Using Link's wolf senses, the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight, as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named Poes.</p>
            <p>The artificial intelligence of enemies in <i>Twilight Princess</i> is more advanced than that of enemies in <i>The Wind Waker</i>. Enemies react to defeated companions and to arrows or slingshot pellets that pass by, and they can detect Link from a greater distance than was possible in previous games.</p>

        <section id="plot">
            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>A teenage boy named Link works as a ranch hand in Ordon Village. One day, Bulblins take away the village's children. Link pursues and encounters a wall of Twilight. A Twilight monster pulls him beyond the wall into the Twilight-shrouded forest, where he is transformed into a wolf and imprisoned. Link is soon freed by a creature named Midna, who offers to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to Princess Zelda, who explains that Zant, the usurper king of the Twili, invaded Hyrule Castle and forced her to surrender. The kingdom became enveloped in Twilight, turning all its inhabitants besides Link and Zelda into invisible spirits. To save Hyrule, Link, aided by Midna, must first revive the Light Spirits by entering the Twilight-covered regions and recovering the Spirits' light from the Twilight beings that have stolen it. Once revitalized, each Spirit returns Link to his Hylian form and informs Link and Midna of the hidden location of a Fused Shadow, one of the fragments of a powerful relic that will have to be used to match Zant's power to defeat him.</p>
            <p>During his journey, Link finds Ordon Village's children and assists the monkeys of Faron, the Gorons of Eldin, and the Zoras of Lanayru. After restoring the Light Spirits and obtaining the Fused Shadows, Link and Midna are ambushed by Zant, who takes away the fragments and reveals that his power comes from another source, which he uses to trap Link in his wolf state. Failing to persuade Midna into joining forces with him, Zant attempts to dispose of her by exposing her to the light of Lanayru's light spirit. Bringing a dying Midna to Zelda, Link learns from her that he needs the Master Sword to remove Zant's curse. She proceeds to sacrifice herself to heal Midna, vanishing mysteriously. Moved by Zelda's act of selflessness, Midna starts to care more about Link and the fate of his world.</p>
            <p>After gaining the Master Sword, Link is cleansed of the curse that kept him in wolf form. Deep within the Gerudo Desert, Link and Midna search for the Mirror of Twilight, the only known gateway between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm, but discover that it is broken. The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but only managed to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the mirror. They also relate that they once used it to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm after failing to execute him. Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the mirror. Once it has been fully restored, the Sages reveal to Link that Midna is actually the true ruler of the Twili, usurped and cursed into her current form by Zant. Confronting Zant, Link and Midna learn that he forged a pact with Ganondorf, who asked for his assistance in subjugating Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna recovers the Fused Shadows and kills Zant after learning that only Ganondorf's defeat can release her from her curse.</p>
            <p>Returning to Hyrule, Link and Midna find Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle, with a lifeless Zelda suspended above him. Ganondorf fights Link by possessing Zelda and then transforming into a gigantic boar-like beast, but Link defeats him by using his wolf form, and the power Midna received from Zelda is able to resuscitate her. Ganondorf revives, and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the Fused Shadows. However, as Hyrule Castle collapses, Ganondorf emerges from it victorious, crushing the Fused Shadow piece that Midna wore on her head, and pursues Link on horseback. Assisted by Zelda and the Light Spirits, Link eventually knocks Ganondorf off his horse and duels him on foot before finishing him off with the Master Sword. With Ganondorf dead, the Light Spirits revive Midna and restore her to her true form. After bidding farewell to Link and Zelda, Midna returns home and destroys the Mirror of Twilight, ultimately severing the link between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm. As Hyrule Castle is rebuilt, Link leaves Ordon Village, heading to parts unknown.</p>

                <h3>Inception as a GameCube game</h3>
                <p>In 2003, Nintendo announced a new Zelda game for the GameCube by the same team that had created the cel-shaded <i>The Wind Waker</i>. At the following year's Game Developers Conference, director Eiji Aonuma unintentionally revealed that it was in development under the working title <i>The Wind Waker 2</i>, with a similar graphical style. Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American sales of <i>The Wind Waker</i> were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that it was designed for a young audience. Aonuma expressed to producer Shigeru Miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic Zelda game that would appeal to the North American market and meet Miyamoto's original vision of realism for the series. Miyamoto, hesitant about solely changing the presentation, suggested the team should focus on gameplay innovations. He advised that Aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, particularly horseback combat. Early development of what would become <i>Twilight Princess</i> began and special care was taken to improve the realism of the horseriding, with lead character designer Keisuke Nishimori riding a horse for himself to feel what it was like.</p>

                    <figcaption>Eiji Aonuma, the director of <i>Twilight Princess</i>, at the 2007 Game Developers Conference.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Just as the original <i>Legend of Zelda</i> was inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> novels, the aesthetic of <i>Twilight Princess</i> was inspired by the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> films, as they had just come out and were very popular at the time. It was developed with a large convincing world in mind, one with a vast scale to meet the expectation for fantasy worlds that audiences had become accustomed to with <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>
                <p>In four months, Aonuma's team managed to present realistic horseback riding, which Nintendo later revealed to the public with a trailer at E3 2004 that was met with enormous praise. The game was scheduled to be released the next year and was no longer a follow-up to <i>The Wind Waker</i>; a true sequel to it was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007, in the form of Phantom Hourglass. Miyamoto explained in interviews that the graphical style was chosen to satisfy demand and that it better fit the theme of an older incarnation of Link. The game runs on a modified <i>The Wind Waker</i> engine.</p>
                <p>Prior Zelda games have employed a theme of two separate, yet connected, worlds. In <i>A Link to the Past</i>, Link travels between a "Light World" and a "Dark World"; in <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, as well as in <i>Oracle of Ages</i>, Link travels between two different time periods. The Zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series' latest installment. It was suggested that Link transform into a wolf, much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the Dark World of <i>A Link to the Past</i>. The concept for Link to transform into a wolf and its surrounding narrative elements came from a dream that Aonuma had while overseas on a business trip. He dreamt that he was a wolf, locked inside a cage, and, after he woke up, he was confused and disoriented and it took a while for him to remember where he was. The story was created by Aonuma, and it later underwent several changes by scenario writers Mitsuhiro Takano and Aya Kyogoku. Takano created the script for the story scenes, while Kyogoku and Takayuki Ikkaku handled the actual in-game script. Originally, Link was planned to be a wolf from the start to bluntly contrast the <i>Ocarina of Time</i> formula, but this was changed so that new players could be eased into the Zelda series' traditional gameplay and narrative formula. The narrative premise in the story regarding the children of Ordon village being kidnapped was an example of the darker story elements.</p>
                <p>The Twilight Realm portions were inspired by the fact that prior Zelda games had always distinctively separated dungeons from the overworld. The team wondered what the result would be if a traditional Zelda dungeon was placed inside the open world instead. This resulted in the hunt for Tears of Light the player partakes in when in the Twilight-covered world. The atmosphere of the Twilight-covered Hyrule, as well as the Twilight Realm dungeon later in the game, were intended to make players feel uncomfortable. Special care was taken, however, to ensure that this was balanced right, so that it did not make the player so uncomfortable that they did not want to progress further or could not enjoy the experience.</p>
                <p>Aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he produced <i>The Minish Cap</i> for the Game Boy Advance. When he returned, he found the <i>Twilight Princess</i> team struggling. Emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made Link's character unbelievable. Aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in <i>Phantom Hourglass</i>, which was being developed with touch controls for the Nintendo DS. At the same time, the Wii was under development with the code name "Revolution". Miyamoto thought that the Revolution's pointing device, the Wii Remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and he suggested that Aonuma consider using it.</p>

            <section id="wii-development">
                <h3>Transition to the Wii</h3>
                <p>Aonuma had anticipated creating a Zelda game for what would later become the Wii, but had assumed that he would need to complete <i>Twilight Princess</i> first. His team began work developing a pointing-based interface for the bow and arrow, and Aonuma found that aiming directly at the screen created a new feel, just like the DS control scheme for <i>Phantom Hourglass</i>. Aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed, but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a GameCube release. Developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced 2005 release, still disappointing the consumer. Nintendo President Satoru Iwata felt that having both versions would satisfy users in the end, even though they would have to wait for the finished product. Aonuma then started working on both versions in parallel.</p>
                <p>Transferring GameCube development to the Wii was relatively simple, since the Wii was being created to be compatible with GameCube software. At E3 2005, Nintendo released a small number of Nintendo DS game cards containing a preview trailer for <i>Twilight Princess</i>. They also announced that a Zelda title would appear on the Wii (then codenamed "Revolution"), but were not clear to the media if this meant <i>Twilight Princess</i> or a different game.</p>
                <p>The team worked on a Wii control scheme, adapting camera control and the fighting mechanics to the new interface. A prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first-person viewpoint but was unable to show the variety of Link's movements. When the third-person view was restored, Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link's left hand, so the entire world map was mirrored for the Wii version. Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication NGC Magazine claimed that when a GameCube copy of <i>Twilight Princess</i> was played on the Revolution, it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller. Miyamoto confirmed the Revolution controller-functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe and Time reported this soon after. However, support for the Wii controller did not make it into the GameCube release. At E3 2006, Nintendo confirmed that both versions would be available at the Wii launch, and had a playable version of <i>Twilight Princess</i> for the Wii. Later, the GameCube release was pushed back to a month after the launch of the Wii.</p>
                <p>Nintendo staff members reported that demo users complained about the difficulty of the control scheme. Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of "forcing" users to adapt, instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use. He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on comfort and ease. The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses. In addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword. To solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures—something E3 attendees had commented they would like to see. This reintroduced the problem of using a right-handed swing to control a left-handed sword attack. The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link's character model, so they instead flipped the entire game—everything was made a mirror image. Link was now right-handed, and references to "east" and "west" were reversed. The GameCube version, however, was left with the original orientation. The <i>Twilight Princess</i> player's guide focuses on the Wii version, but has a section in the back with mirror-image maps for GameCube users.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="sound-development">
                <h3>Music and Sound</h3>
                <p>The score was composed by Toru Minegishi and Asuka Ohta, with series regular Koji Kondo serving as the sound supervisor. Minegishi took charge of composition and sound design in <i>Twilight Princess</i>, providing all field and dungeon music. For the trailers, three pieces were written by different composers, two of which were created by Mahito Yokota and Kondo. Michiru Ōshima created orchestral arrangements for the three compositions, later to be performed by an ensemble conducted by Taizo Takemoto. Kondo's piece was chosen as music for the E3 2005 trailer and for the demo movie after the title screen. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.</p>
                <p>Media requests at the trade show prompted Kondo to consider using orchestral music for the other tracks, a notion reinforced by his preference for live instruments. He originally envisioned a full 50-person orchestra for action sequences and a string quartet for more "lyrical moments", though the final product used sequenced music instead. Kondo later cited the lack of interactivity that comes with orchestral music as one of the main reasons for the decision. Both six- and seven-track versions of the soundtrack were released on November 19, 2006, as part of a <i>Nintendo Power</i> promotion and bundled with replicas of the Master Sword and the Hylian Shield.</p>

            <section id="technical-vulnerability">
                <h3>Technical vulnerability</h3>
                <p>Following the discovery of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Wii version of <i>Twilight Princess</i>, an exploit known as the "Twilight Hack" was developed, allowing the execution of custom code from a Secure Digital (SD) card on the console. A specifically designed save file would cause the game to load unsigned code, which could include Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) programs and homebrew Wii applications. Versions 3.3 and 3.4 of the Wii Menu prevented copying exploited save files onto the console until circumvention methods were discovered, and version 4.0 of the Wii Menu patched the vulnerability.</p>
